# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?
  - Algorithm analysis is the theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
  
- Explain the Big $O$ notation
  - Calculatin time itself is not sufficient to know the efficiency of an algorithm as it can vary based on the input and machine the program is run on. We use Big O notation to calculate the efficiency of the algorithm. it denotes the worst case scenarios. for instance, an optimized algorithm might perform poorly when input is small but as the input increases it becomes more efficient. Therefore, by using Big O notation we denote how the algorithm will perform with large input.
- Compare `Linear`, `Logarithmic`, `Quadratic` and `Constant` complexities.
  - Constant: when the algorithm takes same amount of steps irrespective of the size of input.O(1)
  - Linear: the steps required to complete the execution of an algorithm increase or decrease linearly with the number of inputs. Linear complexity is denoted by O(n). so for N amount of input it will take N amount of time. 
  - Logarithmic: when we are reducing the steps it takes to arrive at the goal at each iteration. example is binary search.
  - Quadratic: when the steps required to execute an algorithm are a quadratic function of the number of items in the input. Quadratic complexity is denoted as O(nÂ²). example: inner loops. 

## Task2

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple algorithm in C++ that finds the square of the first item in a list and then prints it on the screen.
```cpp 
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
 using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int myarray[10] = {21, 43, 23, 54, 75, 13, 5, 8, 25, 10};
    cout << myarray[0] * myarray[0];
}
```
    using namespace std;
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?
  - O(1). Contant complexity

## Task 3

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple program that displays all items in a list to the console.
<code>
#include \<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr_int[] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 };

    for (int i : arr_int) {
        cout << i;

    }
}
</code>
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?
Time complexity is O(N)

## Task 4: : Individual, at home

Refer to this [pdf](./big_o.pdf):

- What is the difference between complexity and performance:
    - Performance refers to the actual amount of resources (time/memory/disk etc.) is consumed while program is running. It is dependant on the code and the machine it is run on. 
    - Complexity is about how does the resource requirement scale when input gets larger. it is usually as a function of the size of the input.
- Does complexity affects performance or is it the other way around?
  - Complexity affects the performance. Complexity of an algorithm provides  expected performance in for instance worst case scenarios, but the actual performance can be influenced by other factors such as the hardware, the implementation, and the input size and distribution. Optimized algorithm might have good runtime theoretically but it might run slower on less powerful machine.
- Restate the formal definition of big $O$ in plain English
    - Big(O) denotes the amount of time it takes to solve a problem, as the size of the input increases. Basically, how running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input becomes larger.
